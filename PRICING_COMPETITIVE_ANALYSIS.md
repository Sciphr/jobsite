   - ‚úÖ **CERTN background checks** (unique to you)

## Pricing Adjustments: Should You Change Anything?

### ‚úÖ Keep As-Is: Your Core Pricing is Solid

Your pricing doesn't need major changes. However, here are minor optimizations:

### üí° Consider Adding:

#### **1. Quarterly Billing Option**
- Monthly: Full price
- Quarterly: 5% off
- Annual: 17% off (2 months free)

**Why**: Some companies prefer quarterly budget planning. Gives them an option between monthly flexibility and annual commitment.

#### **2. "Startup Program" Discount**
- Companies <2 years old with <$1M revenue
- 50% off first 6 months on Professional tier
- Then full price

**Why**: Attract startups early, they grow into full-paying customers. Competitive with startup-focused ATS like Breezy HR.

#### **3. Non-Profit Discount**
- 20% off all tiers for registered non-profits

**Why**: Non-profits have budget constraints but still need hiring tools. Good for brand reputation.

#### **4. Agency/Recruiting Firm Pricing**
- Custom tier for staffing agencies with 50+ jobs
- $999/mo for 51-100 jobs (Professional features)
- Branded as "Agency Plan"

**Why**: Recruiting agencies are a different customer segment with different needs. Willing to pay more for high volume.

## Final Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Things You're Doing Right:

1. **Unlimited users** - This is a game-changer. Keep emphasizing this.
2. **Job-based pricing** - Rare model that makes sense and scales naturally.

2. **Add quarterly billing** - Capture customers who don't want annual but want some discount.
3. **Create comparison page** - Show your pricing next to Greenhouse, Lever, Workable on your site.

### ‚ùå Don't Do:

1. **Don't lower prices** - You're already very competitive
2. **Don't add per-user fees** - This is your superpower
3. **Don't unbundle features** - Keep "all-inclusive" as your brand
4. **Don't offer "freemium"** - Your 14-day trial is perfect
